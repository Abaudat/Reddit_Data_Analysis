In competitive, unit levels are capped to 9 for common, 7 for rares, 4 for epics and 1 for legendary. If your cards are over that level they get downgraded to the cap for the duration of the match, however if they are under the cap they do not get upgraded. Here is the part where you either have to pay money to accelerate things or play as free to play for a long time. \\n\\nPlaying as free to play, you get chests every win that take 4 hours to open, and you get rarer chests every so often. Personally, I played CR for around 8 months and sunk in maybe $50 and I had all units in the game, almost all of them up to tournament levels. \\n\\nHearthstone on the other hand, works pretty much the same way, but instead of getting copies of a card to upgrade it, you need to get lucky and open it in a pack, or get enough duplicates to be able to craft it. If you\\'ve ever played Hearthstone you know it is VERY hard to make it as a free to play player for several reasons:\\n\\n- You get only one quest per day averaging 50 to 60 gold.\\n\\n- You only get gold when you win, so if you just started and have a bad deck you have almost no way to win in casual, and you can only play ~15 games per month against people of your level in ranked before getting to rank 20 and starting to play against meta decks.\\n\\n- You get a pityful 10 gold every 3 wins, that\\'s 30 wins for one pack of 5 cards, most of them commons.\\n\\n- Blizzard typically releases an expansion every 6 months, and you need to have a lot of gold saved up if you want to be able to start playing the new cards when they come out.\\n\\nTo sum it up, imo Hearthstone is more of a pay to win game than tournament style Clash Royale, and once you \"make it\" and can play tournaments on equal footing with other players (by having all cards you need or tournament cap units), it is a LOT easier to stay up to date in CR where they only release a couple units every few months than in Hearthstone where the meta changes every 6 months with a 200 cards expansion.',\n",

I wait 30s from the last player movement (entering/leaving lobby) to start the game with bots replacing the missing players.\\n\\n- Keep up the illusion that bots are real players. I use realistic nicknames, behavior trees/markov chains along with random delays in actions to mimic actual players behaviour as much as I can. I haven\\'t tested this assumption but I\\'m pretty sure players would be quicker to leave if they realized they were playing against bots.\\n\\n- Do not deny the usage of bots when called out on it. The players are not stupid and after several games they will figure out they\\'re playing against CPUs. Several players commented on my Play Store that the game was \"not really multiplayer\" and I usually reply with \"bots are used so you don\\'t have to wait too long to play the game, but why not invite a friend to play with you if you want some PvP action?\" which assesses at the same time that the usage of bots is needed and that the game really has a multiplayer mode and that I didn\\'t just fake it with only bots.\\n\\n- Do not make the bots too hard. The first iteration of bots in my .io game didn\\'t have random delays when undertaking actions, which resulted in them attacking you as soon as you were in range with lightening speed, and they always hit dead center. This was extremely frustrating (even as the programmer) and I quickly added random delays to actions along with random offsets to where the bot was aiming so it could miss.',\n",

This is personal opinion but if you release quality games, you *will* get players and they *will* talk about your game to other potential players. \\n\\nNote that by quality game, I don't mean simply high quality art or high quality sound but a game that is at once:\\n\\n- Fun to play. You should still like playing your game even after developing it for hours on end. This is where most games fail. Even some huge games with enormous development cost sometimes fail at making their games fun.\\n\\n- Innovative. Taking ideas for here and there is fine but your game should be something new for players. For a good example of contrast take a look at .io games: The base is always the same, you're fighting against other players and getting stronger with time and kills. But each .io game has its innovations, one is a remake of snake, another gives you choices of weapons to equip, and so on. They all play differently. Now look at endless runners, which seem to be a popular genre for first games. The base is the same here too, you're running as far as you can without getting killed by the environment. However there is very few points where innovation can come in. Some change the powerups, the enemies, the direction you're running in, but most feel like a reskin of another endless runner you played years ago.\\n\\n- [Juicy](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1016487/Juice-It-or-Lose). Even though this is not absolutely required for a game to succeed, this is often overlooked as for us developers the difference is quite subtle, but it is felt immediately by players. This could be as simple as a window sliding in from the right instead of appearing in the center of the screen.\\n\\nPersonally, I released my first game on the Play Store almost 1 year ago with almost zero marketing (less than 10 retweets on twitter and about 50 players from reddit on launch) and a budget of 0$ and it made 700$ this far. That game had absolutely zero juice. It didn't even have UI sounds for the first month. No music, no animations anywhere. But it was fun to play and innovative so it took off.

No other class compares without having extremely well developed deck that takes time and/or money to make; EVEN THEN it is no guarantee because even his basic deck can go head to head with that.

       " 'There is a server, but the only thing it does is relay messages from one client to the other.\\n\\nIn a typical authoritative setup you have a server owned at least partially by you, with your own code running on it. This server actually runs the game and is always right. The clientside does 3 things: Get information from the server, Show the information on screen and Send information to the server. Ever played a game like LoL or WoW while lagging? You press a key to attack, but it only happens on screen after a while. This is because you are only allowed to show on screen what the server said was happening. Even if you just pressed the attack key, your client doesn\\'t know you are attacking, all it knows is that you sent an update to the server at timestamp x.\\n\\nWith PUN this is mimicked by having a Master Client which is supposed to be the one that is always right, and a server that just relays messages from one client to the others. You can try doing the same as above by having all Slave Clients send updates to the Master and having the Master run the simulation and keep other clients up to date by sending messages, but the problem is that the Master is a player himself. This can cause a lot of different problems that don\\'t exist with a classic server setup.\\n\\nFor starters, what if the Master disconnects? You then need to transfer his responsabilites to the new Master, but you just lost all of the data the Master had to keep track of (cooldowns, score, etc). Latency is a lot higher as well since you need to go to the server, then to another player, back to the server and back to you, which is a very big problem in a realtime game. \\n\\nThe other solution, and the one I used, is to have all the players run the simulation, but have them agree with each other, in this case stating where you attack and having others check if they\\'re hit. The new problem that arises here is that the responsibility to say \"I won\" is given to a player which is a huge security breach.',\n",

All of my cards are tournament level except pump and fireball who are lvl 6.

RG11 will def deal a shitload of damage even when countered by miniP, but I can usually go even by cheesing the barbs.\\n\\nBarbs11 are the hardest to counter but most satisfying when done properly. First, most people who play barbs play them in exactly the same spot every single time, even at 3000 trophies. For a LOT of players that is right in front of the turret as soon as they see your bridge hog. This is incredibly easy to counter, just send a fireball as soon as the hog gets on the bridge and the hog will be able to hit twice, and the enemy will be left with ~150 hp barbs that die to zap or two princess hits.\\n\\nIf you want to go all in, bridge hog with princess 2 squares behind, then fireball the barbs spot and zap the barbs.
